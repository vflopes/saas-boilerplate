# Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is a shared understanding within the team of what it means for work to be considered complete. It ensures that all team members have a clear and consistent view of the quality and completeness required for deliverables.

## User Story and Technical Task

For a user story or task to be considered "done," it must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria Met**: All acceptance criteria defined for the user story are satisfied.
- [ ] **Testing**: A reasonable and relevant code coverage is achieved, and all tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) pass successfully.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Relevant documentation (code comments, user guides, API docs) is updated to reflect changes.
- [ ] **Deployment**: The feature is deployed to the production environment and verified to work as expected.
- [ ] **No Critical Bugs**: There are no critical or high-severity bugs associated with the user story.
