# SaaS Boilerplate

When I started this project, I wanted to create a solid foundation for building micro-SaaS applications quickly and efficiently but applying what I had learned from my career as a software engineer, DevOps/SRE, product manager and entrepreneur. Not only from what I learned, but also from the mistakes I made along the way.

This boilerplate is opinionated and designed to follow best practices, but it is also flexible enough to be adapted to different use cases. It includes a variety of features that are commonly needed in SaaS applications. Its a starting point, not a finished product.
